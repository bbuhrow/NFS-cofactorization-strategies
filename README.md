# nfs_3lp_batch_factor
perform batch factorization using either GCD method or CUDA ECM, of 3LP relations generated by GGNFS lattice siever

# build instructions
Specify your CUDA toolkit version and path in the Makefile by editing lines 6 and 7

If you have a custom GMP location, specify it in lines 9 and 10 of the Makefile

Specify your target CUDA architecture in line 11 (examples: SM=90 for 9.0, SM=80 for 8.0)

If you have a cpu that is AVX512 capable, optionally add SKYLAKEX=1 to the make command

If you have a cpu that is AVX512 and AVX512-IFMA capable, optionally add ICELAKE=1 to the make command

If your cpu does not have AVX2 or BMI2 instructions the build may still work by removing -DUSE_BMI2 and -DUSE_AVX2 from the CFLAGS line (not tested).

example:
make all ICELAKE=1

# usage instructions
unzip the example file rels.zip.  As of now the project only looks for relations in the file rels.raw provided here.

The project implements two methods of batch factorization: GCD based and CUDA-ECM based

select which method to use using command line option -m (--method) 0 for CUDA-ECM or -m (--method) 1 for GCD

If using CUDA-ECM these options are also available:

specify 3LP B1 bound with -b1 option and one of the following integers
-b1 <200, 250, 300, 400, 500>   

specify 3LP B2 bound as a multiplier to B1 using -b2 option.  typical values are 25, 50, or 100
-b2 <int>

specify 3LP number of curves with -c.  typically values are 50, 100, or 200
-c 100

specify 3LP stopping condition with -s. 3LP ECM will stop after not finding any valid factors for -s curves.  typical values are 10, 15, 20
-s 10
